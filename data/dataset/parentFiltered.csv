Example on a job in master: https://travis-ci.com/DPDK/dpdk/builds/149537002/config  Build config validation: root: deprecated key doc_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key build_32b_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key libabigail_build_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key extra_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key aarch64_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: key matrix is an alias for jobs  using jobs  For the ""(anchor on a non-private key)"" warnings  the Travis documentation [1] recommends prefixing private keys with _ (Travis schema is available at [2]).

124,curl/curl,2c598cc77822b27eef5ee6c2810ed6da49ff95bf,1,travis: upgrade to bionic  clang-9  improve readability  Changes  partially to reduce build failures from external dependencies:  - Upgrade Ubuntu and drop unnecessary third-party repos.  - Properly clone apt config to ensure retries.  - Upgrade to clang-9 from the standard repos.  - Use Ubuntu 20.04 focal for the libssh build  use of ssh_get_publickey    fails on -Werror=deprecated-declarations in Ubuntu 18.04. Do not use    focal everywhere yet since Travis CI has not documented this option.    In focal  python-impacket (Py2.7) has been removed  leaving only    python3-impacket. Since it is only needed for SMB tests and not SSH     skip it for the libssh job since it might need more work.  - apt: Remove gcc-8 and libstdc++-8-dev  already installed via g++-8.  Non-functional cleanups:  - Simplify test matrix  drop redundant os and compiler keys.  - Deprecation fixes: remove sudo  rename matrix -> jobs.  - Every job has an 'env' key  put this key first in a list item.  Closes #5370

We add a real shell script and source it from .travis.yml.  This commit squashes a lot changes because we don't want to pollute history with this meta CI stuff.  Highlights of this commit:   - enable make distcheck   - cleanup configure options (enable all progs  with python and docs)   - shorter config.log dump   - out-of-tree build supported   - workaround broken libtool on travis host   - now it's easy to add temporary debugging stuff   - testing locally is possible now  What are we testing now:   - gcc and clang compiler   - configure mostly with --enable-all-programs  --with-python and     --enable-gtk-doc   - make check with and without root permissions   - make distcheck   - make install (with and without --prefix as well as DESTDIR=...)   - usually we always build in-tree but distcheck does out-of-tree  What do we want/expect at all:   - This travis setup is intended to always work without fixing or     updating this build script all the time. Thats why we only use a     few configure flags.   - We want to avoid predictable failures on travis host to not make     developers tired of this machinery. Any tested feature which is     known to be (sometimes) broken should be fixed or skipped as soon     as possible.   - If this works like wanted then in future almost any point in master     commit history should at least survive the build and common tests     on this reference host/arch. Moreover we will have a comparable      deterministic build log history. This could make bisecting real     bugs easier.   - It's not our goal to test any kind of config flags  host setup and     arch combination. This would be done better by external build     scripts which do not live within the project itself.   - Of course this machinery can be also used to reproduce bugs with     more exotic config and host setup by pushing a debug branch with     modified travis script to github.

Makes sense actually  ! -z is kind of reverse logic that confuses  More adjustments on a follow up commit  * netdata/packaging/ci: Enable slack integration for kickstart validation  We want to be notified in a timely manner when the kickstart on the website is outdated. Added a wrapper for incoming webhooks from slack and instead of failing the build we notify slack  Added a debug message in the end of the script to validate the process which i will remove on a follow up commit  * netdata/packaging/ci: fixes fix sourcing path missed the /  this new keyboard is a pain :p

756,falcosecurity/falco,73fbbdb5774d2432f5c0c9d32a15691ac98d3e18,1,"Add automated tests for packages/driver installs  Add automated tests for running falco from a package and container. As a result  this will also test building the kernel module as well as runnning falco-probe-loader as a backup.  In travis.yml  switch to the docker-enabled vm and install dkms. This changed the environment slightly  so change how avocado's python dependencies are installed. After building falco  copy the .deb package to docker/local and build a local docker image based on that package.  Add the following new tests:   - docker_package: this uses ""docker run"" to run the image created in    travis.yml. This includes using dkms to build the kernel module and    load it. In addition  the conf directory is mounted to /host/conf  the    rules directory is mounted to /host/rules  and the traces directory is    mounted to /host/traces.  - docker_package_local_driver: this disables dkms via a volume mount    that maps /dev/null to /usr/sbin/dkms and copies the kernel module by    hand into the container to /root/.sysdig/falco-probe-....ko. As a    result  falco-probe-loader will use the local kernel module instead    of building one itself.  - debian_package: this installs the .deb package and runs the installed    version of falco.  Ideally  there'd also be a test for downloading the driver  but since the driver depends on the kernel as well as the falco version string  you can't put a single driver on download.draios.com that will work long-term.  These tests depend on the following new test attributes:   - package: if present  this points to the docker image/debian package     to install.   - addl_docker_run_args: if present  will be added to the docker run     command.   - copy_local_driver: if present  will copy the built kernel module to     ~/.sysdig. ~/.sysdig/* is always cleared out before each test.   - run_duration: maps to falco's -M <secs> flag   - trace_file is now optional.  Also add some misc general test changes:   - Clean up our use of process.run. By default it will fail a test if the     run program returns non-zero  so we don't have to grab the exit     status. In addition  get rid of sudo in the command lines and use the     sudo attribute instead.    - Fix some tests that were writing to files below /tmp/falco_outputs     by creating the directory first. Useful when running avocado directly."

We already had to explicitly force an older version of Ubuntu Trusty for the asan/lsan build  so keep it that way. In a summary: - Normal builds work fine with newer Ubuntu (if 16.04 can be called ""newer""). - Sanitizers generally work with -fuse-ld=gold  so maybe the BFD ld is   old/broken on these old Ubuntu versions. - Asan/lsan breaks when tests try to terminate the iceccd daemon. Either   the signal handling is broken  or the leak cleanup is broken  it simply   exists and the only thing it says is 'fatal error'. - I have no idea how to fix that. Even when using gcc9   from the ubuntu-toolchain-r-test it's still broken. - So stay on the ancient Trusty version. - However  there's no official zstd package for Trusty  so grab one   from a ""random"" unsupported repository. It works *shrug*. - Also  asan contains lsan  so just use them together  so that the special   handling is at least done only once."

950,microsoft/bond,c8a259f94f9f8145a326e8677dc446d737cc3fc2,1,Refresh Linux CI build image  Updates the Linux CI build image to build-22756092 which was built against commit 62da781cb2.  Due to a combination of two bugs in the clean up script  we've lost all the images except for the one reference by the 8.1.0 tag  build-13234037.  1. The clean up script was supposed to be configured to retain images    reference by all tags. However  it was only retaining the image    reference by the most recent tag. This was fixed by using `git    rev-list --tags --simplify-by-decoration --dense` instead of `git    rev-list --tags -n 1` 2. The clean up script was configured to retain images reference by the    last two weeks of commits. There has been a period without any    commits in two weeks  so the images reference by the current tip of    master were collected. This has been fixed by adding the results of    `git rev-list --reverse -n 10 origin/master` to the set of root    commits.  Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/bond/issues/979

This meant that most coredumps were missed  and debug information was lost.  The new setup configures apport to watch for crashes on any executables (by default it watches for executables from Ubuntu packages). These crash dumps are picked up  extracted  and analysed using GDB to provide a backtrace (this needs the executable to be passed to GDB as well so that debug symbols are provided).  * Restructured .travis.yml to avoid underspecified builds.

With the addition of a new test case  this started causing macOS builds to fail on TravisCI due to exhaustion of space on ramdisk which we use to run tests on for speed. This patch also increases ramfs size on Travis to make tests pass since clean up alone was not enough.  **Test plan**  macOS tests should pass on TravisCI.

2790,mantl/mantl,e5f9bb076095b237e1172e6fd8df69e1162a78af,1,Add logging  set global docker envs in travis  When I ported the setup logic to python  I did not adding any logging output. I have fixed that  by including helpful messages to users on what the setup is currently doing. I also have the setup script set the SSH_KEY env if none is set  instead of aborting.  I was forgetting to add settings to multiple places  so I figured that it was time for some DRY refactoring. This adds global envs for the docker run lines  to make it easier to keep things consistent.  For example  I changed docker run to attach stdout & stderr instead of allocating a pseudo-tty. This change allows the security setup script to generate credentials randomly  as they did before.  The volume parts of the docker run call need to be placed on the same lines  because that's the most direct way to ensure that they are populated to the correct values. If there is a DRY way of doing this  that would be better  but I can't think of anything right now.  During my heavy edits of the travis file  I found that the indentation was inconsistent. I ensured that my editor had the correct tab/space settings  and adjusted the indentation.

These changes combine all of the python scripts into one  travis.py. The idea here is that if you want to add functionality  add to the script.
