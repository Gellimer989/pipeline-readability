C,ClusterLabs/pacemaker,https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/7918bf80cc01938e42a5549d7fa86ccc82ef3b3b,[.gitlab-ci.yml],CI: kick off .gitlab-ci.yml for integration with GitLab CI  We start with a matrix similar to that in .travis.yml: * build + tests  using   - gcc   - clang * various compilation-free immediate maintenance checks  All using Fedora Rawhide  for various reasons: - spot the possible breakages down the line early   (incompatibility in the surrounding software  etc.) - is reasonably trimmed down (now that glibc-all-langpacks   doesn't hog the installation) - close familiarity on the side of developer(s)  at least me :-)  As an extra  experimental measure  we put some hard time limits on some time-criticial execution  since when they get breached regularly  we shall reconsider whether just to bump that value or to change the approach/restructure whole pipeline. Conversely  when we are blocked on an RPM repo mirror  we shall rather give up early.  Another notable point is trying hard to cache the floating bits  so that we  e.g.  do not have to run the full round trip to redownload the packages from an RPM repo mirror all the time. And yet another  we don't (in an outlook  by uncommenting the respective part of the config  actually  since we are currently after the compatibility as back as GitLab 10.8) trigger full-fledged build + test jobs when there's not reason -- neither of relevant source files got changed  meaning another optimization for as lightweight testing as possible.  Unlike with .travis.yml  some properties of the CI run are configured directly in the web interface of the project within GitLab instance (e.g. CI verdict notifications).  Note that thanks to the staged approach  it might be viable (cf. build-once-reuse-arbitrarily) to consider replaying some very basic two node scenarios  for instance; all that's needed: - addressability of the other peer (introspection via API?) - ability to run corosync with some very loose parameters   (note that plain udpu appears more container-friendly   than kronosnet mediation) - ssh-based inter-communication? - way to synchronize initially (since even within the same stage    the individual starts may be triggered in a lockstep for waiting   on free capacities)  TODO: - extend the range of tests ("exec" set omitted as it requires   more dependencies and perhaps some extra fiddling) - verify coverage measurement works as expected   (test jobs seem to regenerate binaries lazily  perhaps because   we trim down the artifacts carried between stages  and hence   possibly without proper flags?) - fix coverage not working with clang - generate coverage report in a nice format to be stored   as an artifact for later perusal - add automated "git bisect" over the tests fallback for convenience - possibly extend over other distributions (Debian/Ubuntu ecosystem   is satisfactorily saturated with Travis CI  though  IMHO)

Example on a job in master: https://travis-ci.com/DPDK/dpdk/builds/149537002/config  Build config validation: root: deprecated key doc_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key build_32b_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key libabigail_build_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key extra_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: deprecated key aarch64_packages (anchor on a non-private key) root: key matrix is an alias for jobs  using jobs  For the "(anchor on a non-private key)" warnings  the Travis documentation [1] recommends prefixing private keys with _ (Travis schema is available at [2]).  The use of the "matrix" key is allowed  but it is just an alias to the "jobs" key.  1: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-config-yaml#private-keys-as-yaml-anchors-and-aliases-and-external-tooling 2: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yml/blob/730a77f4028b91293a55c8c1c52fc72e64379dde/schema.json  Signed-off-by: David Marchand <david.marchand@redhat.com> Acked-by: Aaron Conole <aconole@redhat.com>

To aid the refactoring process and keep the following patches in sync across all three environments  split the code out in travis as well.  Use the buildman -w option for the single board. It is easier to understand since it specifies the output directory directly. Also it avoids needing to look at the internal .bm-work directory.  This initially creates some duplicate code  but by the end of the series we have two completely different build paths with different arguments.

On the other hand  having a separate job for the release build would be a plus.  Additionally  we shouldn't use an opaque script to build GTK; the only step in the process that requires hand-holding is running the tests suites under Xvfb  and having the build options visible from the YAML file gives us a better idea of what kind of build we're running.

GlusterFS is only installed on 64 bit Linux because the   32 bit deb tries to pull in psmisc:i386 which conflicts with the   regular (64 bit) psmisc. The clang 32 bit build works fine but only   the gcc 32 bit build is done to reduce the number of builds for now. - Minor reformatting to make it a bit easier to read the shell script   (but behind the scenes it's still all squashed on to one line). - Stop apt from installing/upgrading non-essential packages so as to   reduce build time. - Make OSX build use a newer Xcode.

Appveyor always provides a 64 bit environment and   Cygwin64 comes with a 32 bit cross-compiler and 32 bit versions of   libraries. - Reduce the clone depth to 1 since we aren't making use of the git   history and it can be a touch faster.

This requires a few things:    * Setting `enable_coverage` to `yes` to produce `gcno` files   * Installing the coveralls command via `pip`   * Allowing `postgres` to write `gdca` files to our checked-out code   * Allowing our own user to read these files once created   * Uploading the coverage data to coveralls  This is a bit ugly at the moment but hopefully this comment illuminates what's being done. We'll clean up when we have more projects using this service.  [cpp-coveralls]: https://github.com/eddyxu/cpp-coveralls [coveralls.io]: https://coveralls.io/

Do not use    focal everywhere yet since Travis CI has not documented this option.    In focal  python-impacket (Py2.7) has been removed  leaving only    python3-impacket. Since it is only needed for SMB tests and not SSH     skip it for the libssh job since it might need more work.  - apt: Remove gcc-8 and libstdc++-8-dev  already installed via g++-8.  Non-functional cleanups:  - Simplify test matrix  drop redundant os and compiler keys.  - Deprecation fixes: remove sudo  rename matrix -> jobs.  - Every job has an 'env' key  put this key first in a list item.

On test runner logic: There was too many code duplication on how checks were executed  it got refactored. No change in semantics.

We add a real shell script and source it from .travis.yml.  This commit squashes a lot changes because we don't want to pollute history with this meta CI stuff.  Highlights of this commit:   - enable make distcheck   - cleanup configure options (enable all progs  with python and docs)   - shorter config.log dump   - out-of-tree build supported   - workaround broken libtool on travis host   - now it's easy to add temporary debugging stuff   - testing locally is possible now  What are we testing now:   - gcc and clang compiler   - configure mostly with --enable-all-programs  --with-python and     --enable-gtk-doc   - make check with and without root permissions   - make distcheck   - make install (with and without --prefix as well as DESTDIR=...)   - usually we always build in-tree but distcheck does out-of-tree  What do we want/expect at all:   - This travis setup is intended to always work without fixing or     updating this build script all the time. Thats why we only use a     few configure flags.   - We want to avoid predictable failures on travis host to not make     developers tired of this machinery. Any tested feature which is     known to be (sometimes) broken should be fixed or skipped as soon     as possible.   - If this works like wanted then in future almost any point in master     commit history should at least survive the build and common tests     on this reference host/arch. Moreover we will have a comparable      deterministic build log history. This could make bisecting real     bugs easier.   - It's not our goal to test any kind of config flags  host setup and     arch combination. This would be done better by external build     scripts which do not live within the project itself.   - Of course this machinery can be also used to reproduce bugs with     more exotic config and host setup by pushing a debug branch with     modified travis script to github.

Fortunately  we can split these tests out into multiple jobs. This seems to be the intended course of action for large CI "builds" in Travis  as this gives Travis a finer grain of control over limiting builds.  Unfortunately  this created a couple issues:  1. The Travis configuration isn't actually that flexible. It allows a    single "matrix expansion" which can be generated from top-level lists    of different configurations. But it doesn't let you generate a matrix    from two seperate environment variable lists (for arch + geometry).     Without multiple matrix expansions  we're stuck writing out each test    permutation by hand.     On the bright-side  this was a good chance to really learn how YAML    anchors work. I'm torn because on one hand anchors add what feels    like unnecessary complexity to a config language  on the other hand     they did help quite a bit in working around Travis's limitations.  2. Now that we have 47 jobs instead of 7  reporting a separate status    for each job stops making sense.     What I've opted for here is to use a special NAME variable to    deduplicate jobs  and used a few state-less rules to hopefully have    the reported status make sense most of the time.     - Overwrite "pending" statuses so that the last job to start owns the      most recent "pending" status    - Don't overwrite "failure" statuses unless the job number matches      our own (in the case of CI restarts)    - Don't write "success" statuses unless the job number matches our      own  this should delay a green check-mark until the last-to-start      job finishes    - Always overwrite non-failures with "failure" statuses     This does mean a temporary "success" may appear if the last job    terminates before earlier jobs. But this is the simpliest solution    I can think of without storing some complex state somewhere.     Note we can only report the size this way because it's cheap to    calculate in every job.

I find warnings to be very disruptive to my workflow (using emacs's "go to next error" feature)  and I periodically have to go clean up other people's drivers to get back to finding my own warnings in the noise.  I know I'm not the only one doing something like this.  We don't want to enable -Werror by default in builds  since it means that end users will have builds spuriously fail based on what compiler version and opt flags they have compared to what the devs are using.  However  it is quite easy to have CI ensure that we at least don't introduce warnings on the compiler version that it uses.  For now I've just enabled it on meson-i386 to cover a bunch of Mesa core and get us started on ratcheting up warnings-cleanliness in the tree  without me having to fix up all the drivers at once.

It is free for open-source projects and tigthly integrated tiwh GitHub so there is really no reason for us not use it. :)  For now we are going to do a total of 4 builds  mainly to test ffmpeg/libav API breakage:   * ffmpeg-stable  libass-stable  * ffmpeg-git  libass-stable  * libav-stable  libass-stable  * libav-git  libass-stable  The compiler that is currently used is clang for two reasons:   * running 8 build targets would be quite wasteful and take a long time  * clang is less tested and used during development than gcc (especially on    linux)  Currently Travis doesn't support OS X environments alongside Linux ones [2]. When it will  we will add a fifth build target to test OS X compilation breakage.  README was moved to markdown to add the little build status image. I ran some tests with my GitHub fork and couldn't get images to show up using ReStructured Text.   [1]: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci  [2]: travis-ci/travis-ci#216

(#7559)  * Skip unit testing during CI when it's not needed.  Our current unit testing takes almost 20 minutes on average during the CI process  which is almost twice as long as any other step  and it's only going to get longer as we get better test coverage.  This commit slightly alters how we handle unit testing during CI so that only those unit tests which are actually needed get run.  This is achieved by using the `$TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` environment variable provided by Travis to determine which commits we're actually testing  and then using that information to query Git for what files actually changed.  As of right now  the only unit testing we're doing is in the dbengine code  so we check to see if any of those files or the C unit testing files are modified by the PR and only runs the unit tests for those if they were modified. The checks are a bit more wide-ranging than they probably need to be so that we make sure to avoid any false negatives.  This should speed up CI checks for PR's (as well as not monopolizing the master branch after every PR that gets merged).  * Restructure to better handle PR's.  The previous code did not work correctly with PR's because it ignored the fact that Travis does not appear to report the full list of commits for a PR in `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`  instead only reporting the most recent set of commits that were pushed.  * Add listing of commits being checked.  This will allow for verification of what is being tested  making it easier to spot issues with the detection logic.  * Don't assume PR's are targeting the master branch.

This consolidates the two separate 'Artifacts Validation' stages we have in Travis into a single stage a s well as fixing an error in the handling of the lifecycle checks.  Overall  this should improve build times for Travis CI checks due to a deduplication of certain lifecycle checks and an overall increase in the parallelizability of the jobs within the stage.  * Fix lifecycle check retry logic.

To aid the refactoring process and keep the following patches in sync across all three environments  split the code out in travis as well.  Use the buildman -w option for the single board. It is easier to understand since it specifies the output directory directly. Also it avoids needing to look at the internal .bm-work directory.  This initially creates some duplicate code  but by the end of the series we have two completely different build paths with different arguments.

We cannot start using   an automatic test system if it is broken from start  that would   only halt all development. - Remove first build and tests step  rely on the Debian build   to execute the build. - Remove travis_wait wrapper  the build should output something   all the time and not have any 10 minute silences. - In general minimize the .travis.yml file as the cmake options   etc need to be inherited from the project itself and not maintained   separately in a travis file. - Remove README.md as the links to Travis CI logs is static and not   useful in any generic branch and clone of this repo.

Number of jobs: - before: 33 (with 7 ignored) - after:  33 (with 7 ignored)  This partially reverts commits c12609d and 193bc89.  Remove unnecessary dependencies that nothing uses: dpatch libzmq-dev  Install extra build dependencies from a PPA specifically tailored for Travis-CI use and which ensures all architectures are supported (in this case s390x is needed and was not available from mariadb.org repos).

After fixing that  I also managed to fix it on the bots: the test builds - natively - a cpp to bitcode  then checks we warn about the triple when we compile such a native bitcode to js/wasm. The problem on CI was that stddef.h is not present  that is  native building doesn't work using clang there for some reason. Not sure why  but in any case  we don't need that  I made the test just build an empty cpp file  which is enough.

I'm surprised we didn't hit more problems earlier  actually...  The regression was that we added a constructor priority in pthreads  and apparently that keeps it not just alive but separate from other ctors  which adds an extra function to the number. I refactored that code to make it clear what we do in the pthreads and non-pthreads cases  and made us only use the priority when using pthreads.

As a result  this will also test building the kernel module as well as runnning falco-probe-loader as a backup.  In travis.yml  switch to the docker-enabled vm and install dkms. This changed the environment slightly  so change how avocado's python dependencies are installed. After building falco  copy the .deb package to docker/local and build a local docker image based on that package.  Add the following new tests:   - docker_package: this uses "docker run" to run the image created in    travis.yml. This includes using dkms to build the kernel module and    load it. In addition  the conf directory is mounted to /host/conf  the    rules directory is mounted to /host/rules  and the traces directory is    mounted to /host/traces.  - docker_package_local_driver: this disables dkms via a volume mount    that maps /dev/null to /usr/sbin/dkms and copies the kernel module by    hand into the container to /root/.sysdig/falco-probe-....ko. As a    result  falco-probe-loader will use the local kernel module instead    of building one itself.  - debian_package: this installs the .deb package and runs the installed    version of falco.  Ideally  there'd also be a test for downloading the driver  but since the driver depends on the kernel as well as the falco version string  you can't put a single driver on download.draios.com that will work long-term.  These tests depend on the following new test attributes:   - package: if present  this points to the docker image/debian package     to install.   - addl_docker_run_args: if present  will be added to the docker run     command.   - copy_local_driver: if present  will copy the built kernel module to     ~/.sysdig. ~/.sysdig/* is always cleared out before each test.   - run_duration: maps to falco's -M <secs> flag   - trace_file is now optional.  Also add some misc general test changes:   - Clean up our use of process.run. By default it will fail a test if the     run program returns non-zero  so we don't have to grab the exit     status. In addition  get rid of sudo in the command lines and use the     sudo attribute instead.    - Fix some tests that were writing to files below /tmp/falco_outputs     by creating the directory first. Useful when running avocado directly.

We already had to explicitly force an older version of Ubuntu Trusty for the asan/lsan build  so keep it that way. In a summary: - Normal builds work fine with newer Ubuntu (if 16.04 can be called "newer"). - Sanitizers generally work with -fuse-ld=gold  so maybe the BFD ld is   old/broken on these old Ubuntu versions. - Asan/lsan breaks when tests try to terminate the iceccd daemon. Either   the signal handling is broken  or the leak cleanup is broken  it simply   exists and the only thing it says is 'fatal error'. - I have no idea how to fix that. Even when using gcc9   from the ubuntu-toolchain-r-test it's still broken. - So stay on the ancient Trusty version. - However  there's no official zstd package for Trusty  so grab one   from a "random" unsupported repository. It works *shrug*. - Also  asan contains lsan  so just use them together  so that the special   handling is at least done only once.

Extends valgrind/sanitizer testing to cover syzygy code.  The script downloads 4 man syzygy as needed. The time needed for the additional testing is small (in fact hard to see a difference compared to the large fluctuations in testing time in travis).  Possible follow-ups:   * include more TB sensitive positions in bench.  * include the test script of recent commit "Refactor tbprobe.cpp".  * verify unchanged bench with TB (with a long run).  * make the TB part of the continuation integration tests optional.  Closes https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1518 and    https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/pull/1490  No functional change.

Due to a combination of two bugs in the clean up script  we've lost all the images except for the one reference by the 8.1.0 tag  build-13234037.  1. The clean up script was supposed to be configured to retain images    reference by all tags. However  it was only retaining the image    reference by the most recent tag. This was fixed by using `git    rev-list --tags --simplify-by-decoration --dense` instead of `git    rev-list --tags -n 1` 2. The clean up script was configured to retain images reference by the    last two weeks of commits. There has been a period without any    commits in two weeks  so the images reference by the current tip of    master were collected. This has been fixed by adding the results of    `git rev-list --reverse -n 10 origin/master` to the set of root    commits.  Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/bond/issues/979

This meant that most coredumps were missed  and debug information was lost.  The new setup configures apport to watch for crashes on any executables (by default it watches for executables from Ubuntu packages). These crash dumps are picked up  extracted  and analysed using GDB to provide a backtrace (this needs the executable to be passed to GDB as well so that debug symbols are provided).  * Restructured .travis.yml to avoid underspecified builds.

This PR the following changes: - Refactor the doc push script into a reusable command - Add command line options for the doc push script.   These don't matter too much for now but will be useful   for setting up future jobs for building different versions of the   docs. - Instead of checking out pytorch/pytorch:master  we re-use the pytorch   installation inside the docker image. - Change the sed in the script to a perl command. sed is annoyingly   different across platforms; the perl command is more stable - Run the script in dry run mode (without pushing the doc build)   whenever a PR is opened.

Category of ops: the ones that doesn’t require observers  which means the quantization parameters(scale/zero_point) of the output of this op can be inferred from the quantization parameters of inputs. For example: avg_pool  max_pool  flatten  transpose  upsample  Another related topic to previous one is how do we deal with things like adaptive_avg_pool2d that does not require to be observed and it works with quantized tensor as well? If we insert quant/dequant for them  even the quant fusion becomes a numerically changing operation because the scale/zero_point for input and output are different.  Proposal  We can swap the operator with dequantize whenever we see it. For example  for pattern Let’s say aten::general_op is defined for both floating point and quantized  %r = aten::conv(...) %q = quantize(%r) %dq = dequantize(%q) %f = aten::general_op(%dq) ...  We detect that all inputs of aten::general_op is produced by dequantize  we’ll first delete all the dequantize for the inputs and then insert dequantize for each use of the output of the aten::general_op  note that this should work generally for all the case we might encounter.  After transformation we’ll have:  %r = aten::conv(...) %q = quantize(%r) %x = aten::general_op(%q) %f = dequantize(%x) ...  1. Multiple inputs     1. We need to make sure all inputs of the aten::general_op are produced by dequantize before we do this transformation 2. Input used by multiple operators     1. We already did this by inserting dequantize for each use of the value 3. Output used by multiple operators     1. We’ll reuse the code that inserts dequantize(might need some refactor)  Note that current concat does not belong to this category right now since it does not inherit quantization parameters from inputs.

Additionally make lots of cleanups to Travis config and make the build a lot faster too.  Also change both Travis and AppVeyor builds to treat warnings as errors  and include VS2017 in the matrix for AppVeyor. I have also removed VS2010 because it is ancient at this point.  Updated Premake to alpha12 and fixed the premake build file appropriately.

However  at the current time  only Oracle JDK 8 is in active use on the project. As such  we allow JDK 11 builds to fail without affecting the build status for the project overall.  In Travis  "jobs" is an alias for "matrix". This is not very clear  and is mentioned casually and off-handedly in their documentation. To help clean up the config file  we also remove the old "matrix" block  squishing it down into the "jobs" block.

Java,facebook/litho,https://github.com/facebook/litho/commit/2c411830d11d08fc2af194d8ea244d0cbdf33f76,[.circleci/config.yml],Restructure Circle CI config.yml to use Workflows  Summary: This PR leverages CircleCI Workflows in order to build samples & run tests in parallel.  It first builds the whole project and then starts to run the following jobs in parallel:  1) `sample` build with BUCK 2) `sample-barebones` build with BUCK 3) `sample-codelab` build with BUCK 4) `sample-kotlin` build with Gradle 5) `litho-it` tests run with BUCK 6) `litho-it-powermock` tests run with BUCK 7) Tests run with Gradle  Every job that runs tests  also stores test results and artifacts. Note on this  the previous `regex` used was not grepping tests results from `litho-it` & `litho-it-powermock`. In order to save those results as well  I modified the jobs that run tests using `BUCK` to output the results in a `*.xml` file respectively.  * Declare any references to be used in following steps * Declare Jobs that will run in Workflow   -  Each Job consists of:      - Container Configuration      - Workspace attaching      - Cache restoration      - Main work execution (checkout code/build/test runs)      - Store tests results (optional)      - Store tests artifacts * Declare the Workflow alongside Jobs execution order and Jobs inter-dependencies  * Currently `Workflow` is based on passy 's Docker image specially created for `Litho`: 1) Based on `circle-ci-android` Docker image 2) Installs `BUCK` 3) Installs `androidSdk` 4) Warms up some caches in order to reduce build time on the first job.  Although this is great  Circle CI caches images on `containers` so it was pretty hard to end up on a container with that specific Docker image cached. It did happen though a few times (luckily enough there were some times I needed quick feedback loop and the container had the image cached)  effectively letting the Job setup the environment in 1 second.  By switching to `circle-ci-android` Docker image and pulling inside a configuration job  that would of course run as a first Job in the `Workflow` would drammatically increase our chances to find a cached Docker image and decrease the 5-6 mins of environment setup to 1 second. Considering the number of jobs in the `Workflow` (10 atm) it can help reduce the average completion time at an order of magnitude 😃  * It took me around 3 days or so 🕵️ * Ultimately final working version in my branch on my fork consisted of 59 fixup commits 😂 * It took 269 job runs to finally get it to work 😮 * Average `Workflow` run is 40 mins (will explain below some tips that can improve the time) ⏲ * CI provisioning is a tough task 😂  ![Cached image inside container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1070871/39297768-10c17ad8-494d-11e8-8884-a420b9fb8e72.png)  ![Final success Workflow run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1070871/39297781-16b11a8e-494d-11e8-9f93-cc8ae944e654.png) Closes https://github.com/facebook/litho/pull/350  Reviewed By: IanChilds  Differential Revision: D7966601  Pulled By: passy  fbshipit-source-id: 0f7601850d542f32dfae0fc0a1929dcde3dc32c4

However  only one of them actually performs the logic. This means that all jobs are spending ~1 min doing nothing  except the one that actually performs the task at hand.  Since we only merge PRs that are passing the build  we don't actually need to gate our release procedure on passing tests.  All in all  this should reduce our Travis CI build time by about 1 minute per job  and make it clearer that we have a separate release task  as well as cleanup our env declarations.

The `aegir` release commands require the `last-successful` build to have run in order to update the last known good build branch.  That build will not run until the external builds pass but we can't make them pass until they can be refactored to use the new API for which we need an rc.  The change to the `.travis.yml` in this PR allows the overall build to pass even though the external module builds are faiilng.

In other words  I've removed the ability to run Sauce Labs testing locally  and instead refactored the scripts to detect the TRAVIS environment variable; npm test will invoke the SauceLabs launcher when ran by Travis CI  and use only PhantomJS when ran locally.  There is only `npm test` and `npm run testing` which appends the --auto-watch flag to Karma. Booya!

JavaScript,meteor/meteor,https://github.com/meteor/meteor/commit/06c90caf8a0deb31e4e49d66893e22914f39bcd3,[.circleci/config.yml],Attempt to generate "docs" during CircleCI tests.  There have been a number of occasions where I have gone to bump the Meteor docs to the next major version  only to find that the docs deployment (which occurs in a separate repository; found at https://github.com/meteor/docs) fails due to code-refactoring which has taken place in its submodule (`code`  which is this Meteor codebase).  In order to provide early warning when a JSDoc declaration in the Meteor code is going to (eventually) break the docs deployment which occurs in a separate repository (https://github.com/meteor/docs)  this commit introduces a simple checkout and doc generation  in the same manner as the docs would in its own repository  within the CircleCI workflow.  It's been configured in a way where it will not stop the normal Meteor test-suite from running  however it will show a separate indicator on GitHub pull-requests as to whether the generation of docs was successful or not.

With the addition of a new test case  this started causing macOS builds to fail on TravisCI due to exhaustion of space on ramdisk which we use to run tests on for speed. This patch also increases ramfs size on Travis to make tests pass since clean up alone was not enough.  **Test plan**  macOS tests should pass on TravisCI.

By setting setting the tab-width to 40 it works around the behavior introduced in https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/pull/1404 which erroneously interprets positioning spaces as indentation. ("If the line started with tabs  but had spaces after that  no error was thrown at all.")  That makes any line lengths checks ineffective  but I think line length checks aren't very useful anyway. They're basically just a (very!) rough indication that you might want to consider some refactoring.

Also clean up the PHP 7.3 build.  This will help avoid any inadvertent 7.4 failures; IMO the sooner we add new releases to the test mix the better.  If this ends up creating intermittent failures outside of our control I would recommend rolling back entirely rather than adding to allowed_failures.  The main goal of testing PHP 7.4 on SS3 sites is to let us keep upgrading PHP versions regularly until the end of SS3’s life.

Django's collectstatic copies files and doesn't preserve timestamps  then only copies "newer modified files".  This leads to a condition where old static files are in /edx/var/edxapp/staticfiles with a timestamp of Yesterday  and we add a new dep which comes down from npm with a timestamp of last week.  Collectstatic will not copy those.

This time I had to use twine tool to upload the zip and whl packages from my local machine to PyPI.  Sorry the mess...

I have fixed that  by including helpful messages to users on what the setup is currently doing. I also have the setup script set the SSH_KEY env if none is set  instead of aborting.  I was forgetting to add settings to multiple places  so I figured that it was time for some DRY refactoring. This adds global envs for the docker run lines  to make it easier to keep things consistent.  For example  I changed docker run to attach stdout & stderr instead of allocating a pseudo-tty. This change allows the security setup script to generate credentials randomly  as they did before.  The volume parts of the docker run call need to be placed on the same lines  because that's the most direct way to ensure that they are populated to the correct values. If there is a DRY way of doing this  that would be better  but I can't think of anything right now.  During my heavy edits of the travis file  I found that the indentation was inconsistent. I ensured that my editor had the correct tab/space settings  and adjusted the indentation.

These changes combine all of the python scripts into one  travis.py. The idea here is that if you want to add functionality  add to the script.  I'm also trying to remove Docker as a dependency for testing. I did spend a lot of time working on it  but it was a cludgy solution to a problem that other tools can fix.

Then I realized that travis.py wasn't expanding envvars still. While I could use the expand env vars functionality in os  I want to explicitly use HOME  since that should be simpler to change in the future.

As rm_work pointed out during the recent haproxy refactor  these conditionals are typically unnecessary - we can rely on Ansible's handler notification system to only trigger handlers when they need to run. This removes a lot of error prone code.  This patch removes conditional handler logic for all services. It is important to ensure that we no longer trigger handlers when unnecessary  because without these checks in place it will trigger a restart of the containers.

In particular  this slows down our `Linux Build Wheels UCS4` shard and our `Linux Build Engine Py2` for a collective cost of 6 minutes every CI run (i.e. total CI cost  not wall time).  Ideally  we would want Python 3 pre-installed on the base Centos6 image so that we never for any shard have to waste time installing Python 3 (see #7064). Until that lands  though  this is an additional unneeded burden.  ### Solution Create a new image `travis_ci_py36`.  Thanks to how we can now parametrize the docker image name in `travis.yml.mustache`  this brings no additional cognitive overload to our `.travis.yml`  which was the original reason we did not create a duplicate Dockerfile.  Also does a little cleanup from https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/7351 in removing a bad env var `$BOOTSTRAP_ARGS` for the linux build engine shards.

While working on https://github.com/pantsbuild/setup/pull/39  a better design came up to de-duplicate individual script entries through anchors.  ### Solution * Introduce new `PYENV_BIN` env var to avoid having to type `${PYENV_ROOT}/bin/pyenv` multiple times. * Define Pyenv env vars globally. They do not hurt anything if we don't use Pyenv on the shard  and allow us to deduplicate code such as which version of Py3 to install.    * Key detail: we first check if $PYENV_ROOT is defined and only redefine if not. Travis's Ubuntu images use Pyenv to get multiple Python versions installed  so we must do this check to avoid overwriting what comes on the system. * Introduce new globally defined commands `pyenv_setup`  `pyenv_install_py36` and `pyenv_global_py36`. * For bootstrapping `pants.pex`  introduce new globally defined commands `aws_deploy_pants_pex` and `aws_get_pants_pex`. * Only build `fs_util` on the Py27 shard.    * OSX was building and deploying for every shard    * Linux was building on Py36 even though we never deployed it.

Publishing a release  drafting one doesn't count  will trigger this workflow.  I personally used GitHub Actions only because it's the CI/CD platform(?) I am familiar with. Only Windows and Linux binaries are supported since I don't have any systems running Mac OS.  For Linux  I had originally planned to use the manylinux2010 docker image the PyPA provides for highly compatible wheel building  but unfortunately it wasn't feasible due to GitHub Actions and PyInstaller incompatibilities. As a stopgap the oldest versions of Linux and Windows are used although Windows Server 2019 isn't that old nor is Ubuntu 16.04! I guess someone (maybe me) could work out something else if compatibility is big problem.  A few things you should know about the workflow:  - You don't need to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret as it is automatically    provided by GitHub.  - matrix.pathsep is used because PyInstaller configuration's format is OS    dependent for some reason ...  Also it's worth mentioning that Black once had Travis CI and AppVeyor configuration that did the same thing as this commit. They were committed in mid 2018 and worked (somewhat) well. Eventually we stopped using AppVeyor and the refactor to packages broke the Travis CI config. This commit replaces the still existing and broken Travis CI config wholesale.  Co-authored-by: Anders Fredrik Kiær <31612826+anders-kiaer@users.noreply.github.com>   - Anders told me that I could get the release asset upload URL directly    from the github.event.release payload. I originally planned to use    bruceadams/get-release to get such URL.

Not sure exactly how xonsh is tested completely  so I expect most of the coverage process to be wrong (for now)  Codecov have [browser extensions](https://github.com/codecov/browser-extension) that allow you to see the coverage directly in the pull requests in GitHub.  We might have to give codecov some limited access to the repo (webhook)  and tell the codecov bot to shut its mouth once it's enabled. But it's super non intrusive  and kind-of useful when you refactor to see that your code is tested.  Also set some sensible where coverage would fail only if it drops by 10% in 1 PR.
