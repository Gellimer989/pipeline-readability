GlusterFS is only installed on 64 bit Linux because the   32 bit deb tries to pull in psmisc:i386 which conflicts with the   regular (64 bit) psmisc. The clang 32 bit build works fine but only   the gcc 32 bit build is done to reduce the number of builds for now. - Minor reformatting to make it a bit easier to read the shell script   (but behind the scenes it's still all squashed on to one line). - Stop apt from installing/upgrading non-essential packages so as to   reduce build time. - Make OSX build use a newer Xcode.

Do not use    focal everywhere yet since Travis CI has not documented this option.    In focal  python-impacket (Py2.7) has been removed  leaving only    python3-impacket. Since it is only needed for SMB tests and not SSH     skip it for the libssh job since it might need more work.  - apt: Remove gcc-8 and libstdc++-8-dev  already installed via g++-8.  Non-functional cleanups:  - Simplify test matrix  drop redundant os and compiler keys.  - Deprecation fixes: remove sudo  rename matrix -> jobs.  - Every job has an 'env' key  put this key first in a list item.

Fortunately  we can split these tests out into multiple jobs. This seems to be the intended course of action for large CI ""builds"" in Travis  as this gives Travis a finer grain of control over limiting builds.  Unfortunately  this created a couple issues:  1. The Travis configuration isn't actually that flexible. It allows a    single ""matrix expansion"" which can be generated from top-level lists    of different configurations. But it doesn't let you generate a matrix    from two seperate environment variable lists (for arch + geometry).     Without multiple matrix expansions  we're stuck writing out each test    permutation by hand.     On the bright-side  this was a good chance to really learn how YAML    anchors work. I'm torn because on one hand anchors add what feels    like unnecessary complexity to a config language  on the other hand     they did help quite a bit in working around Travis's limitations.  2. Now that we have 47 jobs instead of 7  reporting a separate status    for each job stops making sense.     What I've opted for here is to use a special NAME variable to    deduplicate jobs  and used a few state-less rules to hopefully have    the reported status make sense most of the time.     - Overwrite ""pending"" statuses so that the last job to start owns the      most recent ""pending"" status    - Don't overwrite ""failure"" statuses unless the job number matches      our own (in the case of CI restarts)    - Don't write ""success"" statuses unless the job number matches our      own  this should delay a green check-mark until the last-to-start      job finishes    - Always overwrite non-failures with ""failure"" statuses     This does mean a temporary ""success"" may appear if the last job    terminates before earlier jobs. But this is the simpliest solution    I can think of without storing some complex state somewhere.     Note we can only report the size this way because it's cheap to    calculate in every job."

This cleans up the cases and names (and drastically shortens `tox.ini`)  but keeps the old envs available for manual testing.

2886,pantsbuild/pants,c7c06583df9d6337de02f7ea325d6448ebcc1096,1.0,Fix the S3 upload in the travis deploy. (#4813)  - Without the `skip_cleanup: true` stanza travis does a   `git stash --all` before deploying  which removes the   `build-support/bin/native/s3-upload` dir. - Also fixed spelling of `local-dir` to `local_dir`. Travis   apparently normalizes both to the latter  but we may as   well match what appears in the travis documentation  to   reduce confusion among future readers. - Also added some comments/TODOs  for things that weren't   clear to me as a first-time reader of this code.
2890,pantsbuild/pants,8d755d075243e975500de248d86bf9ad29b698fa,1.0,Refactor travis.yml to deduplicate Pyenv and AWS pex code (#7397)  ### Problem Our `.travis.yml` is quite complex. While Mustache has helped with addressing this  we currently duplicate several intricate values like the command to publish `pants.pex` to AWS.  While working on https://github.com/pantsbuild/setup/pull/39  a better design came up to de-duplicate individual script entries through anchors.  ### Solution * Introduce new `PYENV_BIN` env var to avoid having to type `${PYENV_ROOT}/bin/pyenv` multiple times. * Define Pyenv env vars globally. They do not hurt anything if we don't use Pyenv on the shard  and allow us to deduplicate code such as which version of Py3 to install.    * Key detail: we first check if $PYENV_ROOT is defined and only redefine if not. Travis's Ubuntu images use Pyenv to get multiple Python versions installed  so we must do this check to avoid overwriting what comes on the system. * Introduce new globally defined commands `pyenv_setup`  `pyenv_install_py36` and `pyenv_global_py36`. * For bootstrapping `pants.pex`  introduce new globally defined commands `aws_deploy_pants_pex` and `aws_get_pants_pex`. * Only build `fs_util` on the Py27 shard.    * OSX was building and deploying for every shard    * Linux was building on Py36 even though we never deployed it.
